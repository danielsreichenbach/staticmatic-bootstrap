## Welcome to the StaticMatic Bootstrap

(StaticMatic](http://www.staticmatic.net) is a great toolkit when it comes to
quickly build templates for web applications.  This *Bootstrap* combines the
powers of [HAML](http://haml-lang.com), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com),
[Compass](http://compass-style.org) with *StaticMatic* into a local prototyping
environment.

The *Bootstrap* requires a working [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.com) installation
complete with [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org).  Additionally you will need the
following Ruby gems installed:

 * haml, version >= 2.2.0
 * compass, version >= 0.10.0.rc1
 * compass-colors, version >= 0.7.0.pre6
 * staticmatic, version >= 0.10.8

If you want to use any grid system to design your web applications, you may
want to install one or multiple of the gems listed below:

 * compass-susy-plugin
 * compass-960-plugin
 * compass-fluid960-plugin
 * compass-vgrid-plugin

**Notice**: If you want to use any *Compass* plugins to extend the *Bootstrap*
with custom grids, SASS extensions, etc. you will need to add a `require`
statement inside of the Compass configuration file `compass.rb`.
