        This *Bootstrap* combines the powers of [HAML](http://haml-lang.com),
        [SASS](http://sass-lang.com), [Compass](http://compass-style.org) with
        *StaticMatic* into a local prototyping environment.

        ## Rationale

        When I discovered *Compass* and *HAML*/*SASS* it all seemed to be a strange
        approach to developing web application prototypes.  I - much like any other
        developer - already had lots of frameworks for actual development (e.g. Ruby
        on Rails, or CakePHP), so why add more?

        A few months later the answer is clear. In the long run, having everything
        separated into clean, small, manageable chunks will save time for both you
        and your clients.

        ## Examples

        Styling sites and the default elements can be tedious, considering that you
        may find yourself doing it again and again.  Thus this StaticMatic Bootstrap
        includes both default styles for common content plus a few example files to
        actually see these styles in action.

        [HTML Elements](elements) is about every kind of content you might need to
        style.  Start by customizing these styles first to create a general look and
        feel.

        [Readability](readability) has to be evaluated constantly, whenever you apply
        updates and changes to your design.  If your sites' content can not be read
        or seen, why should anyone use it?

      This little project is intended to help designers and developers to enjoy the
      beauty of content, code, and design separation.  If something in here does not
